### Step 1
####Gradle & Maven

dependencies {
    compile 'me.drakeet.library:androiduiview:1.1.0'
}
```

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>me.drakeet.library</groupId>

### Step 2

It's very easy, just like this:

before using, add the namespace code to your xml:
```xml
xmlns:drakeet="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
```

all right, 

```xml
<me.drakeet.library.UIButton
    android:layout_width="64dp"
    android:layout_height="64dp"
    android:layout_margin="16dp"
    drakeet:alpha_pressed="80"
    drakeet:color_pressed="#660303ff"
    android:background="@mipmap/ic_launcher"/>

<me.drakeet.library.UIButton
    android:layout_width="64dp"
    android:layout_height="64dp"
    android:layout_margin="16dp"
    drakeet:shape_type="round"
    android:background="@mipmap/avatar"/>
    
<me.drakeet.library.UIImageView
    android:layout_width="64dp"
    android:layout_height="64dp"
    android:layout_margin="16dp"
    drakeet:shape_type="round"
    android:src="@mipmap/avatar2"/>
```

### Customization

You can change several attributes in the XML file:

* `drakeet:alpha_pressed` [integer def:48 0-255] --> Alpha of the cover color when pressed
* `drakeet:color_pressed` [color def:#9c000000] --> Color of the cover when pressed
* `drakeet:shape_type` [enum (rectangle, round) def:rectangle] --> Rectangle or round of cover or background view shape
* `drakeet:radius` [dimension def:2dp] --> Add a radius to the cover
